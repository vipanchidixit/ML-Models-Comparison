This project compares and evaluates the performance of machine learning models on two different datasets: US Crimes and Diabetes Statistics. Models like Decision Tree, Adaptive Boosting, and Multiclass SVM were used to analyze the US Crimes statistics dataset, while models like Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Logistic Regression were applied to the Diabetes statistics dataset. The project includes a detailed Jupyter notebook with comparative analyses of these models, demonstrating their efficacy through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Extensive preprocessing procedures, such as handling missing values and using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, were carried out to optimize model.Insights on the practicality of different machine learning algorithms for society datasets are provided by this research, which helps in the selection of suitable models for classification problems in many real-world applications.

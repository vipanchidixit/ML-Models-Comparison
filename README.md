This project focuses on evaluating the performance of three distinct machine learning models—Decision Trees, Adaboost, and Multiclass SVM—for the classification of crime rates based on socioeconomic and demographic data. The dataset used includes a comprehensive set of features related to communities, from which non-predictive attributes were initially removed. Through rigorous preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and reducing dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the dataset was refined to enhance model efficiency and accuracy.
